# tweepy_stream

Python application that uses the Tweepy library to capture tweets matching search terms from the Streaming API.

## Version 0.1

This was used to capture climate change tweets for a University of Manchester project (details to follow). Each JSON record is
simply appended to an output file. 

## WIP

Newer version extends functionality by supporting storage of tweets to Neo4j and/or MongoDB as well as direct write to JSON file.

## Requirements

`pip install tweepy`
